In this post we will learn how to use collections from Wix database in a dynamic page. Have a look at the above image. 
In our first row only one post is displaying. In our 2nd and third row 2 posts are displaying but with different widths and equal heights. 
For posts we can set background image or color separately. For different posts we can set different font formatting and font color. 
See third row first column, the text has a glow effect. We can set this glow effect and glow color for any post. 
The background image used in posts can be any image from Wix, may be your uploaded image or link from an external image.
